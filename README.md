# Chrome extension with react and webpack

Just a very basic template to build extension using react and configuring webpack to build the extension.

# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/minhaz1217/chrome-extesion-using-react-and-webpack.git
cd chrome-extesion-using-react-and-webpack
npm -i
```

## Now to run the project
`npm run dev`

## To deploy
`npm run build`

This will generate a dist folder with the extension in it.
